- ðŸ”§ Proficient in Electrical Engineering Tasks, System and Network Administration
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by Email, looreydev@gmail.com

You probably won't find a lot of Code here on GitHub, that's mainly because I'm either working on Private Projects, not coding at all or because I am a proud [Perforce Helix Core](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core) user.
